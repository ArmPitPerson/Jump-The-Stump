# Jump-The-Stump
Jump the stump is a game where you have to jump obstacles that come charging towards you at an increasing rate and speed. Skill and timing will provide you with the highest score possible. The game is written in C++ using the SFML Library.

### Information
This is my first ever SFML game I have made by myself from scratch. I've been reading and learning C++ October 2016 and this is my first game project. I did some smaller practice projects before this just to get around the basics of SFML though. 

The reason the game only has a 1600x900 resolution mode, and no resizing, is because I did not want to mess around with scaling and resizing code for my first project. Hopefully I'll get some more UI elements and implemented in future applications.
