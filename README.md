# Jump-The-Stump
Jump the stump is a game where you have to jump obstacles that come charging towards you at an increasing rate and speed. Skill and timing will provide you with the highest score possible. The game is written in C++ using the SFML Library.

**DISCLAIMER:**

I am unable to provide some font / graphical / audio elements due to IP / Copyright etc, or simply by being unsure if I am allowed to post it as part of this repo (SFML dlls for example). But all the source code is ready to compile (assuming you've set up your compiler to compile SFML). Links to where you can download the used font can be found below. But I supppose the main reason to look at this is how I approached it from a programming standpoint anyway.

### Information
This is my first ever SFML game that I made by myself from scratch. I've been reading C++ Primer since October and this is my first game with actual graphics that I've programmed by myself. I did some smaller practice projects before this just to get around the basics of SFML, but this project was done using myself and the SFML documentation whenever I needed it. Which was every so often. Since this is the first project, some of the code might be bad, unorganized and a little wonky, but the game works, and I have every intention to make future projects more and more structured as I become more skilled.

This is also the reason the game only has a 1600x900 resolution mode, and no resizing, since I didn't want to mess around with scaling and such for my first project. Hopefully I'll get some more UI elements and such implemented in future applications.
